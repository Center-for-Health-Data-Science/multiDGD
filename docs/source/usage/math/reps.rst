Learned representations
========================

Representations are treated as trainable parameters. However, they formally do not belong to the model architecture since they represent the low-dimensional embedding of data.

You can learn more about the representations in the original paper: `Deep Generative Decoder <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/9/btad497/7241685>`_.
