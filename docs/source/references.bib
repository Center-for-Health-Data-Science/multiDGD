ABSTRACT = {Autoencoders are commonly used in representation learning. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward method to map n-dimensional data in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The decoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by manifold learning, we showed that the decoder can be trained on its own by learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derived expressions for the number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and showed that the decoder generally requires much fewer training samples to be well-specified compared to the encoder. We discuss the training of autoencoders in this perspective and relate it to previous work in the field that uses noisy training examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrated that the decoder is much better suited to learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further showed that the decoder alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved conceptual understanding of representation learning.},

    abstract = "{Learning low-dimensional representations of single-cell transcriptomics has become instrumental to its downstream analysis. The state of the art is currently represented by neural network models, such as variational autoencoders, which use a variational approximation of the likelihood for inference.We here present the Deep Generative Decoder (DGD), a simple generative model that computes model parameters and representations directly via maximum a posteriori estimation. The DGD handles complex parameterized latent distributions naturally unlike variational autoencoders, which typically use a fixed Gaussian distribution, because of the complexity of adding other types. We first show its general functionality on a commonly used benchmark set, Fashion-MNIST. Secondly, we apply the model to multiple single-cell datasets. Here, the DGD learns low-dimensional, meaningful, and well-structured latent representations with sub-clustering beyond the provided labels. The advantages of this approach are its simplicity and its capability to provide representations of much smaller dimensionality than a comparable variational autoencoder.scDGD is available as a python package at https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/scDGD. The remaining code is made available here: https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/dgd.}",

	abstract = {Recent technological advancements in single-cell genomics have enabled joint profiling of gene expression and alternative modalities at unprecedented scale. Consequently, the complexity of multi-omics data sets is increasing massively. Existing models for multi-modal data are typically limited in functionality or scalability, making data integration and downstream analysis cumbersome. We present multiDGD, a scalable deep generative model providing a probabilistic framework to learn shared representations of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. It shows outstanding performance on data reconstruction without feature selection. We demonstrate on several data sets from human and mouse that multiDGD learns well-clustered joint representations. We further find that probabilistic modelling of sample covatiates enables post-hoc data integration without the need for fine-tuning. Additionally, we show that multiDGD can detect statistical associations between genes and regulatory regions conditioned on the learned representations. multiDGD is available as an scverse-compatible package (https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/multiDGD).Competing Interest StatementS.A.T. is a Scientific Advisory Board member of ForeSite Labs, Qiagen and Element Biosciences, and is a co-founder and equity holder of TransitionBio and EnsoCell Therapeutics.},
